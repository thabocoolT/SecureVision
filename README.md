# SecureVision
SecureVision is an intelligent facial recognition security solution that uses live camera input to identify authorized users. Its primary purpose is to protect systems by enabling secure login, automatic locking, or session termination when an unauthorized face is detected.

Purpose

The primary purpose of SecureVision is to provide secure, automated access control by verifying a user’s identity through facial recognition. When an authorized face is detected, access is granted. If an unauthorized face is detected or no face is present, the system can automatically lock or log out the user.

🚀 Key Features

Real-time facial recognition using a camera feed

Secure user authentication without passwords

Automatic system lock or logout when an unauthorized user is detected

Continuous monitoring for added security

Designed to work independently of built-in OS facial recognition tools

🧠 How It Works

The system captures live video from the device’s camera.

Facial features are detected and analyzed using computer vision algorithms.

The detected face is compared against registered/authorized user data.

Based on the result:

✅ Access is granted for authorized users

🔒 The system locks or logs out for unauthorized users
